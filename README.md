# FizzBuzz in Go using TDD

## Description

This repository contains an implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem using Go and following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

## Problem Statement

Your task is to write a program that prints one line for each number from 1 to 100:
- Usually, just print the number itself.
- For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of five, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
